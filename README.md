# Project3
# Matplotlib and pyplot
# Project Objectives 
This exercise is used to reinforce key Python visualization skills. It offers practice with web-enabled Jupyter notebooks and lays some important foundations for presenting information obtained from mining the web and processing language
# Note
Anytime we use an external library (something not included in the Python Standard Library) like Matplotlib,  we'll need to:
install it into our active virtual environment and
use an import statement in our Python.

# Project Overview 

1. Get the starter repo into your GitHub account <https://github.com/wmnlp-materials/pyplot/blob/master/pyplot.ipynb>
2. clone down your repo to your local machine,
3. start up Jupyter lab (or Jupyter Notebook),
4. make edits to Markdown cells and Python code cells
5. add and commit your changes using Git
6. push your commit up to the GitHub repo.
7. export your notebook as HTML (a web page) for submission using the menu

# Task
1. On your machine, open the Jupyter Notebook for editing.
2. In your Markdown introduction, add a viewable, clickable link to your GitHub repo after your name. Build your brand and make your Markdown introduction clear and professional.
3. Use Markdown headings  (e.g. Question 1) to clearly show your content by each question number.
4. Complete the first task.
5. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
6. Complete the second task.
7. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
8.  Work this way until all tasks have been completed.

# Export to HTML and Finalize Repo
1. Execute each notebook.
2.  After executing, export each notebook to HTML.
3. Commit and push your HTML files to your GitHub repo along with the executed notebooks.
4. Verify you have a professional README.md that introduces your GitHub repository and provides helpful information about your project.
